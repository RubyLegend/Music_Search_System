[Verse 1]  
No one gets left behind  
This time there's no casualties  
This time I look the other way  
Other way  
Get used to what's coming now  
Is that all way too familiar  
Is that what you want you want  
  
[Verse 2]  
Something new we search  
Something that varies from this all  
Is that what you want  
You want  
We get used to what's surrounding  
That's all way too familiar  
But that's not what you want  
You want  
  
[Hook]  
One voice united  
We make the choices  
One change divided  
We make it united  
One voice united  
We make the choices  
One change divided  
We make it united  

[Bridge]  
Well it's you and me  
We let ourselves to get burned  
Well it's you and me  
This gotta be love and learn  
Well it's you and me  
We let ourselves to get burned  
Well it's you and me  
This gotta be love and learn  
  
[Hook]  
One voice united  
We make the choices  
One change divided  
We make it united  
One voice united  
We make the choices  
One change divided  
We make it united
