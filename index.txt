[Verse 1]  
Many miles away from home  
The steps so difficult, I'm exhausted  
But I did not fall, I hope  
Something good is coming up  
Free like a bird, but also bound  
Look at my footsteps on the ground  
I raise my head, listen to the sound  
I'm happy with what I have found  
  
[Chorus]  
Just breathe, just breathe, just breathe  
Just breathe, just breathe, just breathe  
Just breathe, just breathe, just breathe  
Just breathe, just breathe, just breathe  
  
[Verse 2]  
No one ever told me how hard it's gonna be  
My way is full of branches like the roots of a tree  
Where should I go from here?  
I need a good advice  
The Elders waiting for me at sunrise  
I'm in a prison with open doors  
Ten directions on the floor  
I lose my mind, lose my sight  
Tell me how I'm gonna win this fight  

[Chorus]  
Just breathe, just breathe, just breathe  
Just breathe, just breathe, just breathe  
  
[Verse 3]  
Take the courage babe  
Everybody breaks  
This is not your fate  
Have a new take  
'Cause I would rather die  
Than have to live a life  
Not being who I wanna be  
'Cause I would rather die  
'Cause I would rather die  
Not being who I wanna be  
Just breathe  
'Cause I would rather die  
'Cause I would rather die  
Just breathe  
Take the courage babe  
Everybody breaks  
'Cause I would rather die  
This is not your fate  
'Cause I would rather die
