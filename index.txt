[Verse]  
My father told me  
It’s a beautiful life  
So make sure you  
Always open up your eyes  
To all the adventures  
Go against the tide  
Before you know it  
You'll be running out of time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You should fight for who you wanna be  
Don't look back on what it could've been  
You’ll find it  
You’ll find it  
You could make your way across the sea  
Find new places you ain't never been  
Now I believe  
Now I believe  
  
[Chorus]  
I’ll live a life that’s filled with stories to be told  
I‘ll make it through the darkness and make sure I’m coming home  
And even if I’m walking all alone  
I’m always coming home  
I’m always coming home

I’m always coming home  
  
I’m always coming home  
I’m always coming home
